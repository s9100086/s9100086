- 👋 Hi, I’m s9100086 and aka DrJay@UNSW on Twitter.
- 👀 I’m interested in C++ and C# programming and extensively use CLR. 
- 🌱 I’m currently developing foreground user interfaces and beackground computational engines for advanced control systems that drives driverless field vehicles for agriculture. We will soon be deploying machinery in vineyards for mowing the inter-row spaces autonomously. 
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate at the moment, however, this could be a future possibility for networking and developing cloud based or non-resident computaional engines for autonomous field vehicles.
- 📫 I am reachable on J.Katupitiya/\fieldrobotics.com.au
